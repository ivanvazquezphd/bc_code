## Learning Objectives

* Describe what R is.
* Interact with R using RStudio.
* Familiarize with RStudio components.
* Describe data types and define variables

## Introduction

This training is a first in a series for our 2022 “Series on Bioinformatics” starting April 27th, 2022. This is a great opportunity to build the skills needed to succeed in bioinformatics from the ground up. The workshops will be taught by postdocs with years of experience in bioinformatics.

## What is R?

* Free and open-source programming language
* Used for statistics and data visualization
* Important for science, business, education, etc.
* Considered an in-demand skill to learn

## Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

* [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org), also known as CRAN. 
* CRAN is R's central software repository, supported by the R Foundation
* Network of ftp and web servers store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R
* Hosts many add-on packages used to extend the functionality of R

## What is RStudio?

* RStudio is an open source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
* Rather than using a terminal, RStudio provides a graphical user interface that is platform agnostic and integrates additional packages, project management, version control, and notebooks.

## Getting started with R and RStudio

* Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)
* There are versions for many operating systems
* Install RStudio Desktop from [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### RStudio Basics

Once you open RStudio, you will see four main panes. Each will contain different information. You can see my screen below. 

![](r-Studio.png)

Starting from the top left pane and going from left to right, we have the descriptions of each pane below:

1. __Source Editor__: This pane is where you can write R scripts or notebooks. You can write in other programming languages if you wanted to as well. Each document will have its own tab. Code written here can be run with the `Run` command. 
2. __Environment__: This pane displays objects, variables, and functions that are generated in your R session. There is also a history of all code that was run.
3. __Console__: This pane is where you can type commands and interactively run  R code. The output will display in the console.
4. __Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer__: This pane has several tabs that are important.
    + _Files_: This tab shows the structure and content of a directory on your computer. This could be your working directory or a directory that you manually navigated to.
    + _Plots_: This tab will display plots or figures as an output from the console.
    + _Packages_: This tab contains a list of all packages that are installed. Packages that are loaded in your R session will have a checked box.
    + _Help_: This tab reveals the help pages for an R package or function.
    + _Viewer_: This tab shows compiled R Markdown documents.

### Starting a new project in RStudio
When working with R, it is always a good idea to create a new project directory. This will help you keep your files and data organized by project.

To get started:
  1. Open RStudio
  2. Go to the File menu and select New Project.
  3. In the New Project window, choose New Directory. Then, choose New Project. Name your new directory. You can use a name like, Basics-in-R, and then “Create the project as subdirectory of:” in a location of your choice.
  4. Click on Create Project.
  5. The project should open up automatically in Rstudio. 

We can view our working directory by using the function `getwd()`
```{r eval = F}
getwd()
```


Your working directory will be the location where R will automatically look for files. If you want to find files in a different location, you will either need to provide the full path or type the path in relation to the working directory. Files that you output will automatically save into your working directory unless a path is provided.

To organize your working directory, it is highly recommended to generate sub-folders like `data/` or `results/`. You can do so in the Files tab and select `New Folder`. 

### Basic math calculations in R
Below are some of the most common math calculations that can be done in R.

Operation       | Symbol
--------------  | ------
Addition        | `a + b`
Subtraction     | `a - b`
Multiplication  | `a * b`
Division        | `a / b`
Exponent        | `a ^ b`
Remainder       | `a %% b`
Integer Division| `a %/% b`

For instance, here is an example of addition. 
```{r eval = F}
5 + 3
```

***
**Exercise**

1. Use R as a calculate and find the square root of 10

***

### Functions in R
R has several pre-built functions. For instance, we can use `sum()` instead of the `+` symbol for addition. 
```{r eval = F}
sum(1,3) #This gives the sum of 1 and 3
```

We can also call the _R documentation_ for a function by using `?` before the function name. The documentation will show up under the Help tab. It contains information regarding description, usage, and arguments for a function. 
```{r eval = F}
?sum #Find the R Documentation for sum()
```

![](sum_help.png)

***
**Exercise**

1. Use `sum()` to add the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

***

### Math functions in R
In addition to the basic calculations, there are many common pre-built math functions in R.

Operation          | Function
-----------------  | ------
Square root        | `sqrt()`  
Logarithm          | `log()`         
Logarithm, base 10 | `log10()`
Exponential        | `exp()`
Summation          | `sum()`
Round              | `round()`
Mean               | `mean()`
Median             | `median()`
Minimum            | `min()`
Maximum            | `max()`

```{r eval = F}
#What is the square root of 10?
sqrt(10)
```

***
**Exercise**

1. Find the round the summation of 10.13 and 53.535 to one decimal place.
2. Hint: try `?round` for help. 

***

### Defining variables
A key aspect of programming is defining variables. We store data or values as variables so that we can use in other functions or recall it at a later time. It allows us to save time by storing the data and not having to re-calculate it again. R has two _assignment operators_ for defining variables: `<-` and `=`. The operator `<-` can be used anywhere, whereas the operator `=` is only allowed at the top level. 

```{r eval = F}
x <- 1
y <- 15.3
```

Let's add `x` and `y`. 
```{r eval = F}
#What is in x + y?
x + y 
```

Importantly, when defining variable names, ensure that you use an _informative_ name. This enables yourself and others when reviewing code to know how the variable was used. For instance, we used `x` and `y` in the examples, but their meaning is unknown. Something like `country_population` or `room_capacity` provides better definition for a variable.

### R Data Types
There are different types of data in R, which can be stored as a variable. Below is a table of some of the most commonly used data types.
  
|  Data Type     | Definition                                                    |  Example |
|  ------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------  |  ---------
|  numeric       | Any number value                                              | `3.14`            |
|  integer       | Any whole number value                                        | `42`              |
|  character     | Any number of ASCII characters                                | `"Hello world!"`  |
|                | defined within quotation marks                                |                   |
|  logical       | A value of `TRUE` or `FALSE`                                  | `TRUE`            |
|  factor        | A categorical type of data                                    | `#> [1] Male Male Male Female Female` |
|                |                                                               |`#> Levels: Male Female`|           
The function `class()` can be used to find out the type of data that you are dealing with.
```{r eval = F}
x <- 3
class(x)
```

```{r eval = F}
x <- TRUE
class(x)
```

### Relational and Logical Operators
In R, there are relational operators that compare values between two variables. Typically, these are numerical equalities or inequalities. The result of comparison is a Boolean value. 

Operator    |  Description
----------  |  ------
`<`         |  less than 
`<=`        |  less than or equal to       
`>`         |  greater than
`>=`        |  greater than or equal to
`==`        |  equal to
`!=`        |  not equal to
`%in%`      |  is 'in' a given vector

```{r eval = F}
#Is 3 greater than 5?
3 > 5
```

There are also logical operators which connect two or more expressions depending on the meaning of the operator. These are typically combined with relational operators. 

Operator    |  Description
----------  |  ------
`|`         |  OR
`&`         |  AND
`!`         |  NOT

```{r eval = F}
#Is 3 greater than 1 and 5?
3 > 1 & 3 > 5

#Is 3 greater than 1 or 5?
3 > 1 | 3 > 5
```

## R Data Objects

### Vectors
Vectors are a data structure in R containing one or more values. In fact, you may have noticed a `[1]` in the output of `x`. This indicates that it is a vector of length `1`.

```{r eval = F}
length(x) #This function gives you the length of a vector
```

We use the function `c()` to define a vector with multiple elements. The `c` stands for combine. 
```{r eval = F}
my_first_vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5) #We can also do this with the following, 1:5 instead of c()
my_first_vector
```

We can add more elements to the same vector.
```{r eval = F}
my_first_vector <- c(my_first_vector, 6,7)
my_first_vector
```

We can call specific elements in a vector by using a process called _indexing_. Basically, we can subset specific elements of a vector for further analysis. We do this by defining which position we want in brackets `[]` after the vector.
```{r eval = F}
#Let's take out the 3rd element
my_first_vector[3]
```

What if we wanted to select multiple elements? We can use another vector with the positions we want.
```{r eval = F}
#Let's take out the 2nd and 4th elements
my_first_vector[c(2,4)]
```

We can also do the opposite and select all elements but a single or multiple element by using `-`.
```{r eval = F}
#Let's keep all but the 5th element
my_first_vector[-5]
```

```{r eval = F}
#Let's keep all but the 1st and 3rd elements
my_first_vector[-c(1,3)]
```

Importantly, R functions are typically _vectorized_. This means that the function will perform its operation on all elements of the vector without having to loop through for each element. 

```{r eval = F}
my_first_vector
my_first_vector * 2
```

We can also test some of math functions we listed above.
```{r eval = F}
mean(my_first_vector) #This gives the mean of a numeric vector
min(my_first_vector) #This gives the minimum numeric value in a vector
max(my_first_vector) #This gives the maximmum numeric value in a vector
```

### Matrices
Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. The dimension attribute tells us how many rows and columns the matrix has.

The `matrix()` function is used to create a function. We provide the values, # of rows and # of columns. 

```{r eval = F}
#matrix of sequence 1 to 6 with two rows and three columnss
my_matrix <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
print(my_matrix)
```

```{r eval = F}
dim(my_matrix)
```

```{r eval = F}
my_matrix[1,2] #first row and second column
```

Matrices can be created by adding vectors using `cbind()`
```{r eval = F}
vector_1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
vector_2 <- c(2,3,4,5)

matrix_1 <- cbind(vector_1, vector_2)
print(matrix_1)
```

***
**Exercise**

1. Create a matrix containing a sequence from 1 to 10 with 5 rows and 2 columns
2. Add a row vector of values c(3,5) to the matrix

***

### List
Lists are a special type of vector or R object can contain elements of different classes.

Lists can be explicitly created using the `list()` function.

```{r eval = F}
my_list <- list('I love science!', 1, TRUE)
print(my_list)
```
Like vectors, we can use indexing to select specific elements of a list. Using single brackets `[]` will create a new list with the index or indeces selected.
```{r eval = F}
my_list[1:2]
```

Using double brackets `[[]]` will not create a new list and only selects the element. 
```{r eval = F}
my_list[[1]]
```

***
**Exercise**

1. Can we do my_list[1,2]?
2. Can we do my_list[[2:3]]?

***

### Data Frames
Data frames can be used tabular data in R. You can think of it as an excel worksheet. Also, unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column.

Data frames can be created using the `data.frame()` function.

```{r eval = F}
my_dataframe <- data.frame(A = 1:5, B = c(T, T, F, F, T))
print(my_dataframe)
```

## Installing Packages
While R comes with many pre-load packages, additional functionality can be acheived by install packages through CRAN, Github, or Bioconductor. These packages add new functions that can simplify very complex calculations and scripts into one line.

### CRAN
As we discussed before, CRAN is the official repository for R packages. To install a package, you use the following function: `install.packages()`. The package name in quotations is the argument for this function. For example, we can install a `ggplot2`, which we will use later. 

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

We can load the package by using the `library()` function. In the case for `ggplot2` we do the following:
```{r eval = F}
library(ggplot2)
```


### Other Repositories
* [Github](https://github.com), which is an online software repository provider, hosts several respositories of open-sources R packages. There are several R packages that be can be found in early phases of development that you can find and test out. Github is not limited to R and software written in other languages can be found there too. Oftentimes once the software has completed development or has reached a major version, it may move to CRAN or Bioconductor. 

* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) is a repository that focuses on R packages for biological assays. They host packages for analysis of microarrays, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, amongst many more. 

## Working with Data
A major reason many use R is to analyze data in a reproducible manner. We can read in data through several means.

### Reading in data
There are several methods for reading in tabular data. 

* `read.csv()`
* `read.table()`
* `read.delim()`

All of the above function perfrom similarly in that they import tabuluar data such as those in `.csv` or `.txt` format. 

```{r eval = F}
iris <- read.csv(file = 'iris_dataset.csv')
```

### Exploring your data

The data that we imported is the `Iris` data set. It is a well-known data set of classifying iris plants.  Let's see what type of data we imported by using the `class()` function. 

```{r eval = F}
class(iris)
```

We use `dim()` to see how many rows and columns the data has.

```{r eval = F}
dim(iris) #find rows and columns
```

To explore the first 6 row, we can use the `head()` function. This may be helpful when analyzing large data sets. 

```{r eval = F}
head(iris)
```

There are 4 columns that are made up of numbers and one with strings. The fifth column `Species` is the classification.

***
**Exercise**

1. How can we look at more than 6 rows when using `head()`?

***

This tells us that there are 150 rows and 5 columns in this data frame. It is also good practice to use the `str` function to briefly look at the structure of the data.

```{r eval = F}
str(iris)
```

Again, this confirmed our brief look earlier that there are 4 columns of numeric values. Using `summmary()`, we can acquire some insight on the data distribution. 

```{r eval = F}
summary(iris)
```

We can start by looking at the data point distribution of `Sepal.Length` between the three species. We use the library `ggplot2` and create a scatter plot with `geom_point()`

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(y = Sepal.Length, x = Species, color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Saving data
When working with R, you may acccumulate several proecessed data in the Environment pane that you want to save and load at another time. In addition, you may want to send this data to another system that has R. 

If you are keeping good practices, you would have maintained a notebook and had all your code saved. In that case, you could re-run all the code, but it will take time and computation power.

Saving the data as an R data file will time, computational power, and memory. 

There are a few ways to save your data. 

We can use `saveRDS()` to compress a single object as an `.rds`.
```{r eval = F}
saveRDS(iris, file = "my_data_iris.rds")
```

To load the data, use the `readRDS()` function. You need to have the path to the file. 
```{r eval = F}
readRDS(file = "my_data_iris.rds")
```

Using the `save()` function, we can save multiple files as an `.Rdata`. 
```{r eval = F}
# Save multiple objects
save(iris, my_matrix, file = "iris_my_matrix.RData")
```

To load the data again, use the `load()` function.
```{r eval = F}
load("iris_my_matrix.RData")
```


```{r eval = F}
# Save all objects
save.image(file = "my_work_space.RData")

# Load your environment
load("my_work_space.RData")
```

## Best Practices
  1. Document your code, thoughts, and decision making. Keep this in a `.Rmd` or `.r` file. Use `#` for commenting. This will aid in reproducible of your code for yourself and others.
  2. Create and work inside an R project. This helps with code and data organization. 
  3. Use informative naming for variables. Try to stay from `x`, `y`, or similar.
  4. Practice and keep learning!
