* Familiarize with RStudio components.
* Describe data types define variables

## Introduction

This training is a first in a series for our 2022 “Series on Bioinformatics” starting April 27th, 2022. This is a great opportunity to build the skills needed to succeed in bioinformatics from the ground up. The workshops will be taught by postdocs with years of experience in bioinformatics.

## What is R?

* Free and open-source programming language
* Used for statistics and data visualization
* Important for science, business, education, etc.
* Considered an in-demand skill to learn

## Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

* [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org), also known as CRAN. 
* CRAN is R's central software repository, supported by the R Foundation
* Network of ftp and web servers store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R
* Hosts many add-on packages used to extend the functionality of R

## What is RStudio?

* RStudio is an open source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
* Rather than using a terminal, RStudio provides a graphical user interface that is platform agnostic and integrates additional packages, project management, version control, and notebooks.

## Getting started with R and RStudio

* Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)
* There are versions for many operating systems
* Install RStudio Desktop from [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### RStudio Basics

Once you open RStudio, you will see four main panes. Each will contain different information. You can see my screen below. 

![](images/RStudio.png)

Starting from the top left pane and going from left to right, we have the descriptions of each pane below:

1. __Source Editor__: This pane is where you can write R scripts or notebooks. You can write in other programming languages if you wanted to as well. Each document will have its own tab. Code written here can be run with the `Run` command. 
2. __Environment__: This pane displays objects, variables, and functions that are generated in your R session. There is also a history of all code that was run.
3. __Console__: This pane is where you can type commands and interactively run  R code. The output will display in the console.
4. __Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer__: This pane has several tabs that are important.
    + _Files_: This tab shows the structure and content of a directory on your computer. This could be your working directory or a directory that you manually navigated to.
    + _Plots_: This tab will display plots or figures as an output from the console.
    + _Packages_: This tab contains a list of all packages that are installed. Packages that are loaded in your R session will have a checked box.
    + _Help_: This tab reveals the help pages for an R package or function.
    + _Viewer_: This tab shows compiled R Markdown documents.

### Starting a new project in RStudio
When working with R, it is always a good idea to create a new project directory. This will help you keep your files and data organized by project.

To get started:
  1. Open RStudio
  2. Go to the File menu and select New Project.
  3. In the New Project window, choose New Directory. Then, choose New Project. Name your new directory. You can use a name like, Basics-in-R, and then “Create the project as subdirectory of:” in a location of your choice.
  4. Click on Create Project.
  5. The project should open up automatically in Rstudio. 

We can view our working directory by using the function `getwd()`
```{r eval = F}
getwd()
```

```{r eval = F, class.source= 'white'}
[1] "/Users/dtruong4/Desktop/Basics-in-R"
```

Your working directory will be the location where R will automatically look for files. If you want to find files in a different location, you will either need to provide the full path or type the path in relation to the working directory. Files that you output will automatically save into your working directory unless a path is provided.

To organize your working directory, it is highly recommended to generate sub-folders like `data/` or `results/`. You can do so in the Files tab and select `New Folder`. 

### Basic math calculations in R
Below are some of the most common math calculations that can be done in R.

Operation       | Symbol
--------------  | ------
Addition        | `a + b`
Subtraction     | `a - b`
Multiplication  | `a * b`
Division        | `a / b`
Exponent        | `a ^ b`
Remainder       | `a %% b`
Integer Division| `a %/% b`

For instance, here is an example of addition. 
```{r}
5 + 3
```

***
**Exercise**

1. Use R as a calculate and find the square root of 10

***

### Functions in R
R has several pre-built functions. For instance, we can use `sum()` instead of the `+` symbol for addition. 
```{r}
sum(1,3) #This gives the sum of 1 and 3
```

We can also call the _R documentation_ for a function by using `?` before the function name. The documentation will show up under the Help tab. It contains information regarding description, usage, and arguments for a function. 
```{r}
?sum #Find the R Documentation for sum()
```

***
**Exercise**

1. Use `sum()` to add the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

### Math functions in R
In addition to the basic calculations, there are many common pre-built math functions in R.

Operation          | Function
-----------------  | ------
Square root        | `sqrt()`  
Logarithm          | `log()`         
Logarithm, base 10 | `log10()`
Exponential        | `exp()`
Summation          | `sum()`
Round              | `round()`
Mean               | `mean()`
Median             | `median()`
Minimum            | `min()`
Maximum            | `max()`

```{r}
#What is the square root of 10?
sqrt(10)
```

***
**Exercise**

1. Find the round the summation of 10.13 and 53.535 to one decimal place.
2. Hint: try `?round` for help.

### Defining variables
A key aspect of programming is defining variables. We store data or values as variables so that we can use in other functions or recall it at a later time. It allows us to save time by storing the data and not having to re-calculate it again. R has two _assignment operators_ for defining variables: `<-` and `=`. The operator `<-` can be used anywhere, whereas the operator `=` is only allowed at the top level. 

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 15.3
```

Let's add `x` and `y`. 
```{r}
#What is in x + y?
x + y 
```


Importantly, when defining variable names, ensure that you use an _informative_ name. This enables yourself and others when reviewing code to know how the variable was used. For instance, we used `x` and `y` in the examples, but their meaning is unknown. Something like `country_population` or `room_capacity` provides better definition for a variable.

### R Data Types
There are different types of data in R, which can be stored as a variable. Below is a table of some of the most commonly used data types.
  
|  Data Type     | Definition                                                    |  Example |
|  ------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------  |  ---------
|  numeric       | Any number value                                              | `3.14`            |
|  integer       | Any whole number value                                        | `42`              |
|  character     | Any number of ASCII characters                                | `"Hello world!"`  |
|                | defined within quotation marks                                |                   |
|  logical       | A value of `TRUE` or `FALSE`                                  | `TRUE`            |
|  factor        | A categorical type of data                                    | `#> [1] Male Male Male Female Female` |
|                |                                                               |`#> Levels: Male Female`|           
The function `class()` can be used to find out the type of data that you are dealing with.
```{r}
x <- 3
class(x)
```

```{r}
x <- TRUE
class(x)
```

### Vectors
Vectors are a data structure in R containing one or more values. In fact, you may have noticed a `[1]` in the output of `x`. This indicates that it is a vector of length `1`.

```{r}
length(x) #This function gives you the length of a vector
```

We use the function `c()` to define a vector with multiple elements. The `c` stands for combine. 
```{r}
my_first_vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5) #We can also do this with the following, 1:5 instead of c()
my_first_vector
```

We can add more elements to the same vector.
```{r}
my_first_vector <- c(my_first_vector, 6,7)
my_first_vector
```

We can call specific elements in a vector by using a process called _indexing_. Basically, we can subset specific elements of a vector for further analysis. We do this by defining which position we want in brackets `[]` after the vector.
```{r}
#Let's take out the 3rd element
my_first_vector[3]
```

What if we wanted to select multiple elements? We can use another vector with the positions we want.
```{r}
#Let's take out the 2nd and 4th elements
my_first_vector[c(2,4)]
```

We can also do the opposite and select all elements but a single or multiple element by using `-`.
```{r}
#Let's keep all but the 5th element
my_first_vector[-5]
```
```{r}
#Let's keep all but the 1st and 3rd elements
my_first_vector[-c(1,3)]
```

Importantly, R functions are typically _vectorized_. This means that the function will perform its operation on all elements of the vector without having to loop through for each element. 

```{r}
my_first_vector
my_first_vector * 2
```

We can also test some of math functions we listed above.
```{r}
mean(my_first_vector) #This gives the mean of a numeric vector
min(my_first_vector) #This gives the minimum numeric value in a vector
max(my_first_vector) #This gives the maximmum numeric value in a vector
```

### Relational and Logical Operators
In R, there are relational operators that compare values between two variables. Typically, these are numerical equalities or inequalities. The result of comparison is a Boolean value. 

Operator    |  Description
----------  |  ------
`<`         |  less than 
`<=`        |  less than or equal to       
`>`         |  greater than
`>=`        |  greater than or equal to
`==`        |  equal to
`!=`        |  not equal to
`%in%`      |  is 'in' a given vector

```{r}
#Is 3 greater than 5?
3 > 5
```

We can use the `%in%` operator to determine if a given value is in a vector.
```{r}
#Is 5 in 1 through 10?
5 %in% 1:10
```

```{r}
#Is 'a' in c('a','b','c')?
'a' %in% c('a','b','c')
```

There are also logical operators which connect two or more expressions depending on the meaning of the operator. These are typically combined with relational operators. 

Operator    |  Description
----------  |  ------
`|`         |  OR
`&`         |  AND
`!`         |  NOT

```{r}
#Is 3 greater than 1 and 5?
3 > 1 & 3 > 5

#Is 3 greater than 1 or 5?
3 > 1 | 3 > 5
```

## Saving data

## Best Practices
  1. Document your code, thoughts, and decision making. Keep this in a `.Rmd` or `.r` file. Use `#` for commenting. This will aid in reproducible of your code for yourself and others.
  2. Create and work inside an R project. This helps with code and data organization. 
  3. Use informative naming for variables. Try to stay from `x`, `y`, or similar.
  4. Do create functions to simplify your code. 
  5. Practice and keep learning!
